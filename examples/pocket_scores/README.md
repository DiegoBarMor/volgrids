1) If running this example with the template sh scripts:
    - Make sure to prepare the testdata input by following [this instructions](https://github.com/DiegoBarMor/volgrids-testdata) up to the point when `tests/_gen_input.sh` is executed.

2) Executed `examples/pocket_scores/run.sh` (make sure to be in the root of this repo).
3) If changes are made in the scoring function / plotting of the scores, there's no need to use `run.sh` again. Just run `examples/pocket_scores/scores.py` directly.
