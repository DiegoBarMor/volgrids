[SELECTION_QUERY]
resname IPH

[RES_HPHOBICITY]
IPH: 0.94 # global residue scale, in this example approximated with IPH ~ TYR (prot)

[ATOM_HPHOBICITY]
IPH/C1:  1.01 # atom scales of the format resname/atomname
IPH/C2:  1.05 # in this example they're arbitrary just to show their syntax
*/C3:    1.05 # you can also use the * wildcard to apply for any resname (in case the selection query covers multiple residues)
IPH/C4:  1.10
IPH/C5:  1.05
IPH/C6:  1.05
IPH/O1: -0.05

[NAMES_STACKING]
IPH: C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 # the SMIF will be placed in their center of geometry

[NAMES_HBACCEPTORS]
IPH: C1-O1 # formatted as antecedent-acceptor

### in the case of multiple antecedents (think of the O in furane),
### you can place both antecedents in the format: a1.a2-acceptor
### then a "pseudo-antecedent" will be considered in the point between the 'a1' and 'a2' antecedents
### and used to calculate the axis of rotation for the gaussian

[NAMES_HBDONORS]
IPH: C1-O1 # formatted as antecedent-donor

### same format rule of a1.a2-donor can be used here for complicated cases

[NAMES_HBD_FIXED]
### a section can be empty too
